    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div id="aboutmediv">
      <p>I grew up in, Winnetka, Ill. a small northern suburb of Chicago and went
        to New Trier High School. I have two brothers, Evan and Trevor. Evan recently
        graduated from the University of Iowa and has gone into the real estate business,
        working in downtown Chicago at @Properties. Trevor is a senior at the University
        of California Los Angeles majoring in math and statistics. My mom works off and on doing business consulting and my dad recently
        retired from his job as the VP of menu management at McDonalds.</p>
	      <p>I’m halfway through my junior year at the University of Miami, where I’m majoring
        in broadcast journalism, while minoring in sports administration and geography.
        I’ve been announcing UM sports for the student radio station, WVUM, since the
        beginning of freshmen year. I’m very passionate about sports, whether it’s
        writing, watching, playing or announcing. My goal is make it in the sports
        media industry either as an analyst or a play-by-play announcer. My dream
        job would be announcing for the Cleveland Indians.</p>
