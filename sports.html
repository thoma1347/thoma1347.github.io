      <p><strong>Why You Should Actually Root For the Indians in the World Series</strong></p>

        <p>Throughout the entire playoffs, all anyone wants to talk about is the Cubs.
          From Facebook to ESPN to every GroupMe you’re in, people just won’t shut up
          about the ‘North Siders.’ Even worse, for a Chicago-born Indians fan, it
          feels as though everyone wants them to win the World Series.</p>
        <p>And why wouldn’t you?</p>
        <p>The last time the Cubs won it all women couldn’t vote, the Titanic hadn’t
          been built yet and lollapalooza was just a word used to describe something
          outstanding. Baseball headlines from that time looked like:</p>
        <p>“Honus Wagner Steals Four Bases, Including Second Base, Third Base and Home
          Plate in the Second Inning Against the New York Giants. Not to be Outdone,
          his Teammate Fred Clarke Also Swipes Four Bases.”</p>
        <p>Wrigley field is a historic park with a cursed team. But now it’s renovated,
          loud as hell and Cubs are the best team in baseball. They’re young, fun to
          watch, extremely talented and love playing the game of baseball. It’s a
          fairy tale story that writers have been waiting years to produce.</p>
        <p>So why shouldn’t you root for the Cubs to win it all?</p>
        <p>The loveable losers from Chicago have played the role of underdog for decades,
          cheering for them is like cheering for a coin to land on its side, it’s
          pointless and you’re going to disappointed with the result.</p>
        <p>But now the Cubs have been the favorite to win the World Series since before
          last season even finished, and have been regarded as the best team in baseball
          the entire season. They lost Kyle Schwarber at the beginning of the season but
          that’s the only real adversity they’ve faced. And they went into the playoffs
          as they went into the regular season, with a healthy rotation and as the
          favorite to win it all.</p>
        <p>When I envision the Cubs winning it all, I envision an underdog team that’s
          scrappy and has to claw out victories. The 2003 team that fell to the Marlins
          is much closer to what I picture. They finished the regular season with the
          4th best record in the N.L. and the 9th best in baseball. That would’ve been
          the perfect team to end the drought – not a borderline Superteam.</p>
        <p>But the main reason you shouldn’t root for the Cubs is the team in the other dugout.</p>
        <p>The Indians have been so historically bad they inspired the movie “Major League,”
          a film about a team purposely designed to be so bad that the owner can move them to
          Florida. The Indians haven’t won a World Series since 1948. That’s clearly shorter
          than the Cubs but is still the 2nd longest streak in baseball. But the Indians
          have experienced more heart break.</p>
        <p>In 1995 the Indians had a team much like the Cubs have now, with household names
          like Jim Thome, Manny Ramirez, Albert Belle, Kenny Lofton and Orel Hershiser. That
          team won 100 games (3 games fewer than the Cubs this year) in a season shortened
          by 18 games.</p>
        <p>The Tribe lost the World Series in ’95 in 6 games but were back again in ’97.
          This team was a grind-it-out-type team (like the ’03 Cubs) and only won 86 games
          in the regular season. Even through 6 games the Indians headed to face the
          Marlins in game 7.</p>
        <p>Up 2-1 in the bottom of the 9th Jose Mesa allowed a run and then after a costly
          error on a routine ground ball, the Indians lost in the bottom of the 11th on a
          2-out seeing eye bloop-liner through up the middle.</p>
        <p>Now that is heartbreak.</p>
        <p>Cubs fans will always say how Steve Bartman blew their chance at winning the World
          Series in 2003. But that was just game 6 of the NLCS, and it’s not like anyone
          scored or advanced on that play, it just went down as a foul ball. The Indians on
          the other hand became the first team in baseball to ever lose a game 7 of the
          world series after leading going into the 9th.</p>
        <p>So the Indians know heartbreak better than the Cubs.</p>
        <p>This Indians team has had a form of heartbreak just this season, too. Their best player,
          Michael Brantley, appeared in just 11 games this year, and none since the beginning of
          May.</p>
        <p>But that’s not even scratching the surface of the adversity this team has gone through.</p>
        <p>They have had their 2 catchers each go on the 60-day DL this year in addition to
          losing SP Carlos Corrrasco twice to the DL including missing all of October baseball.</p>
        <p>On top of that, there’s Danny Salazar being added to the DL in August, making his latest
          appearance all the way back on September 9th. But wait, let’s throw in former Cy Young
          winner Corey Kluber missing the end of the regular season with a quad injury and his
          status being up the air for the ALDS.</p>
        <p>Now that is adversity.</p>
        <p>Then Trevor Bauer, as only he could do, injured his hand on a drone and was only able
          to record 2 outs in game 3 of the ALCS against the Blue Jays; leaving the Indians with
          no choice but to pitch Ryan Merritt, a rookie with only 11 innings of Major League
          ball to his name, to pitch on the road in Toronto in Game 5. And all he did was
          shut down the Jays explosive offense on the way to the Indians clinching the series.</p>
        <p>So why root against the Cubs?</p>
        <p>To root for the Indians.</p>
        <p>This team has been to hell and back, and then to hell again with a one-way ticket, only
          to somehow return. On September 17th the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran a major story with
          the headline, “Sept. 17: The day Cleveland Indians’ postseason dreams ended before they
          began.</p>
        <p>And if <em>all</em> of that is not enough to convince you, well, consider this:
          Jason Kipnis grew up down the block from Steve Bartman, the most hated fan in North
          Chicago. If that’s not an eye-opening coincidence, then I don’t know what is…</p>
        <p>All I do know is that it just wouldn’t be baseball if the Cubs didn’t blow this World
          Series.</p>

          <p><strong>Hurricane Warning: FSU Better Take Cover</strong></p>
            <p>Miami – Florida State is the best rivalry in college sports, and it comes down
              to a simple fact: the best high school players in the nation come from Florida,
              and the two powerhouses have always done well in their own (and each other’s)
              backyards. It also doesn’t hurt that the programs have a combined eight national
              championships between them, and have competed in some of college football’s
              most memorable games – anyone remember the first Wide Right?</p>
            <p>Of those 8 national championships, Miami has 5  (tied for the 6th most) and
              FSU has 3 (tied for 10th). The two programs consistently rank amongst the
              most historic football schools in the nation. And across the 60 prior meetings,
              the rivalry is evenly split: Miami 31 to FSU 29.</p>
            <p>Recently, however, this rivalry has been a little one sided with the Seminoles
              taking the last six meetings, but that’s about to change this weekend. FSU’s
              dominance the past few seasons has just been a mirage – completely a consequence
              of Miami sanctions and a series of sub-par coaches for the ‘Canes. Loss of
              scholarships drained talent from Miami and brought it right to Jimbo Fisher’s
              doorstep, as recruits became hesitant to commit to Miami in fear of even greater
              sanctions.</p>
            <p>But now the Canes are back at full strength, and replaced those terrible coaches
              with a great one; an alumnus of the school, Mark Richt. Miami finally has all of
              its scholarships at its disposal, and the stink of Nevin Shapiro has finally
              dissipated – the Canes are finally fully loaded for this Saturday night primetime
              battle in Miami.</p>
            <p>FSU comes into this weekend losing two of their last three, while Miami comes in on
              a role. There’s two ways you can look at this game: this Seminole team is already
              morally defeated and will come out flat, or they’re determined to make sure that
              all the work they put in over the offseason isn’t for naught by week 6.</p>
            <p>Florida State is certainly embarrassed and what better way to salvage their
              season then by beating an arch-rival. The Seminoles won’t go down easy, they
              are better than their record suggests – It will be close most of the way.</p>
            <p>However Brad Kaaya wants this win more than anyone. The star quarterback has yet
              to beat the ‘Noles and what better way to accomplish that then in an ACC home
              opener ushering in a new era with Mark Richt.</p>
            <p>Miami students and fans have been waiting for this game for a long time
              (seven years to be exact). The winds are raising in South Florida, both
              figuratively and literally. The fan base is rabid, the players are hungry,
              and Florida State is about to remember what it feels like to get caught in
              a Hurricane.</p>
            <p>Prediction: 31-21 Miami. Go Canes.</p>

              <p>Three games down and three dominant victories for Miami. But are the
                Hurricanes ready to take the next step? Miami’s first two wins didn’t
                mean much; Kaaya looked average and the opposing teams were standard opening
                season cupcake games.</p>
              <p>Three games down and three dominant victories for Miami. But are the Hurricanes
                ready to take the next step? Miami’s first two wins didn’t mean much; Kaaya
                looked average and the opposing teams were standard opening season cupcake
                games.</p>
              <p>Many fans, I’m sure believe playing Appalachian State sounds like a random
                easy game, and that the Mountaineers (West Virginia apparently isn’t the only
                school rockin’ that mascot) are only known for pulling off that one historic
                upset at ‘the big house’.</p>
              <p>But they certainly qualify as a quality opponent. A couple weeks ago App State
                lost a heartbreaker on the road in overtime to #9 Tennessee. They controlled the
                whole game and didn’t trail until overtime. Meanwhile Miami played the Mountaineers
                on the road in front of an energized crowd hosting the biggest football game in the
                history of Boone, N.C.</p>
              <p>Miami’s offense is going to be a serious threat all season long. Saturday Brad Kaaya
                threw for 368 yards and 3 TDs while Mark Walton racked up his third straight 100 yard
                rushing performance on the year and his 6th and 7th rushing TDs of the season. Yet the
                Hurricanes defense looks even better. In three games UM’s defense has given up a
                measly 23 points and has yet to allow 250 yards in a game.</p>
              <p>Additionally this weekend also saw Florida State get utterly demolished and Notre Dame
                lose at home. While this could diminish some hype around two future games for the
                Canes, it seems that as Miami’s season is going along their schedule is shaping up
                to be easier than previously thought.</p>
              <p>UM’s schedule going into week one had 3 ranked teams on it, 2 of which were in the
                top 10. Now it has one ranked team in FSU, who Miami will face at in the Canes ACC
                home opener. On top of that they don’t play #3 Louisville or #5 Clemson this season.
                Going into this year I had the usual expectations, an 8-4 season with an interesting
                bowl matchup. And maybe it’s too early but I’m throwing that prediction out like Miami
                threw out Al Golden.</p>
              <p>The hype is real. The quarterback will soon play on Sundays. The running backs look
                unstoppable. The defense, at least so far, a wall stronger than one Trump could even
                dream up. And maybe Miami hasn’t really been tested yet. But come that time I think
                they’ll be prepared, and I think the Canes will play in their first ever ACC Football
                Championship Game. Because when you have the athletes Miami does in addition to having
                Kaaya and Richt, you just have to ask yourself what Curt Shilling kept asking the Red
                Sox when they were down three games to none against the Yankees… “Why not us?”</p>
